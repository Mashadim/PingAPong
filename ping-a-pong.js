/** Tips:
    *window.onload makes sure all code and graphics are loaded first before player can start game.
    *var canvasContext is where to draw graphics inside of the canvas.
    *addEventListener take events(already made like mousemove, mouseclick etc) and a function(declared or anonymous).
    *the fillStyle method sets or returns the color, gradient, or pattern used to fill the drawing.
    *fillRect method takes arguments. draws a filled rectangle. 0, 0 are x,y coordinates. They start at top left. x moves right, y moves down.
    *canvas.width and canvas.height is getting info from gameCanvas id.
    *Items drawn last overlap items before it.
    *const means the assigned value cannot be changed later.
    * object.fillText(text, X, Y). Inherits whatever color we are using.

** arc()
    * There is no circle function in HTML5. Use arc().
    * arc(X, Y, Radius/Size, Angle, Radians, whichSide).
    * In rectangle X and Y are in a TOPLEFT of the rectangle. In arc X and Y are in the CENTER of the circle.
    * If radius is 10, the circle will be 20pixels wide, 20pixels tall. Why? Diameter of circle=2r. So 10 * 2=20.
    * PI is half a circle. So 2PI is the entire circle. Can do Math.Pi/2 for kinda-pacman look.
    * True or False, depending what you pick will show one side of the circle and vice versa.
    * If Y and Radius is same number the ball will skim at the top. (ex) (ballx, 100, 100, 0 etc...)
